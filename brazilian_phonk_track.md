|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intro**    | (0:00 - 0:15) | Begins with the menacing "risada terror" laugh sample, followed by a siren and a vinyl scratch. A distorted kick drum slowly fades in, building anticipation.                                                                                                                   |
| **Buildup**  | (0:15 - 0:30) | The kick drum becomes more prominent, and a simple, repetitive 808 sub-bass pattern is introduced. The "fica, fica, fica" vocal chant begins, increasing in speed and intensity.                                                                                                      |
| **Drop**     | (0:30 - 1:00) | An explosive drop featuring the full pancadão kick, a driving 808 sub-bass, and a classic funk snare. The "DJ, solta o ponto!" shout-out introduces the main section, which is dominated by aggressive, chopped vocal phrases and the evil laugh sample.                       |
| **Breakdown**| (1:00 - 1:15) | The beat cuts out abruptly, leaving only the evil laugh sample and a siren. The "fica, fica, fica" chant returns, creating a moment of tension before the second drop.                                                                                                         |
| **Second Drop**| (1:15 - 1:45) | A more intense and chaotic version of the first drop, with additional vocal chops and DJ shout-outs. The kick drum is even more distorted, and the bass is pushed to its limits.                                                                                                |
| **Outro**    | (1:45 - 2:00) | The track ends with a sudden cut, leaving only the evil laugh sample to fade out with a delay effect.                                                                                                                                                                     |
